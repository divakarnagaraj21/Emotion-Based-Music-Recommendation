🎶 Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System
🧠 Overview
The Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System is an AI-powered project that detects the user’s facial emotion in real-time using a webcam and then suggests music that matches their mood.

It combines Computer Vision for emotion detection and Recommendation AI for personalized song selection — offering a smart, human-like user experience.

🚀 Features
✅ Real-time face detection using webcam
✅ Emotion recognition using deep learning (CNN with MobileNetV2)
✅ Music recommendation based on detected emotion
✅ Transfer learning for efficient training on limited data
✅ Modular and extendable — can connect with Spotify API or local music player
